# ðŸ–± 42Paris Project - Security | rainfall

## Objectives

This project is a **modest introduction** to the wide world of cyber security.  A world where you'll gave no margin for errors.  

It aims to discover, through several little challenges, cyber security in various fields.  

In the repository, you'll find as many **folders** as there are **levels**. In this folders, a text file named **"walkthrough"** that brings all the explanation to pass each levels.  
The file **.pass** in the level folder refers to the pass of the next level, the file source is the "ez-understanding" of what happend in the binary. That's the new step of this project, reverse engineering.

## Usage

To make this project, we have to use a VM (64bits) and starts it with the ISO provided with the subject. Once the machine is started, an IP is provided to connect with ssh.  

`ssh levelX@IP -p 4242`  

The username and password is level0 - level0, the username will increase as we go along in the project (level1, 2... until level9) and bonus part starts at bonus0.  
For each levels we have to exploit a binary found on the home repository to get access to the .pass file of the next user level.
